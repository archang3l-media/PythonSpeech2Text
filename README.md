# GO AWAY VOICE MESSAGE

Since I'm in way too many meetings and get way too many voice messages on instant Messengers, I created a working Speech2Text Model in Python for processing voice messages.

### Features:
- Takes Audiofile as Input
- Extracts speech from the audio
- Uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe the extracted speech to text
